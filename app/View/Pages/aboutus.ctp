                <h6>The VT Philosophy</h6>
                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    A Venture Technology company invests technology as a Venture Capital company invests money. A typical software product or ICT solution provider or ICT consulting firm would like to to sell you a pre-packaged solution or charge you large fees to build a custom solution and then walk away. As a VT company, we have a different philosophy. By taking the role of technology patron, Software End aligns itself with YOUR business objectives - namely increased revenues, profitability and increase the branding value.
                    We take an active role in defining and building the best solution possible bu human and making certain that it achieves the results you expect. As an investment partner, we are committed to supporting you so we both can win. Our fees and royalties vary based on the level of venture investment and we would like to make in order to realize a higher return later through equity ownership, transaction fees, or other revenue options. As a technology investment partner, we can help you with marketing and operational plans, providing you with the benefit of an experienced technology perspective of your business rather than someone who simply says what it takes to get a contract.
